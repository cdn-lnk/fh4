Think about natural frequency of the harmonic oscilator

Springs
- harder springs = less body roll = less suspension travel = less camber change (sounds like an all around setup)
- harder springs = more load transfer = more load on outer tires = less balance between wheels
- harder springs = more impact absorption (after jumps for example)

If your suspension keeps camber stable (e.g.: double wishbone) then springs should be as soft as you can

Height
- lower = more compressed springs
- lower = less impact absorption (think about rally jumps)
- lower = less load transfer

Brake while going forward
- front rebound
- rear bump

Brake while reversing
- front bump
- rear rebound

Dampers
- If front and back have the same spring rate then Rear damper = sqrt(Rear Weight/Front Weight) * Front Damper
- If front and back have the same damp ratio then Rear spring = Front Weight/Rear Weight * Front spring
- But why would you want same spring or same damp ratio in front and back ?
- Use the equation for critically damped harmonic oscillator: f*b^2 = m*k (b = damper, m = mass, k = spring, f=convertion factor)
- From what I could discover f ~= 820 <<< This is only true for Audi TTS, other cars have different value.
- In real life enginners dont go for critically damped. You want the dampers a little softer to allow overvshoting and return faster.
